	NOTE: The LabClient can be launched with URL request parameters for ServiceUrl, LabServerId and MultiSubmit. This
	allows the one deployment of the LabClient web application to be used with multiple ServiceBrokers and LabServers.
	
	An example URL that uses the Microsoft Visual Studio development .NET C# code is:
	
	/faces/LabClient.xhtml?LabServerId=8C0BA543419E4d4ab340d449acd3e057&ServiceUrl=http://localhost:8081/ServiceBrokerService.asmx&CouponId=12345&Passkey=qwerty
	
	Also Note: During development in the NetBeans IDE, the run properties of the LabClient web application must specify
	the following relative URL to communicate with the Dummy ServiceBroker:
	
	/faces/LabClient.xhtml?CouponId=12345&Passkey=qwerty
	
	-->
