    <!-- ServiceUrl: ServiceBroker's web service URL -->

    <!--

    NOTE: The LabClient can be launched with URL request parameters for LabServerId, ServiceUrl and MultiSubmit. This
    allows the one deployment of the LabClient web application to be used with multiple ServiceBrokers and LabServers.

    An example URL that uses the Microsoft Visual Studio development .NET C# code is:

    /LabClient.do?ServiceUrl=http://localhost:8081/ServiceBrokerService.asmx&LabServerId=8C0BA543419E4d4ab340d449acd3e057&MultiSubmit=true

    Also Note: During development in the NetBeans IDE, the run properties of the LabClient web application must specify
    the following request parameters to communicate with the Dummy ServiceBroker:

    /LabClient.do?CouponId=12345&Passkey=qwerty

    -->
